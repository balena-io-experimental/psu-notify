# PSU-notify

In order to pretest power supplies when deploying Raspberry Pi device types, simply deploy this app to the device(s)
used to test and watch for the green LED blinking! If it blinks, your power supply stinks.

The red onboard LED will _also_ blink, but only while the voltage is low. Therefore this project helps better monitor for any
historical events.
